# Admission Prediction

In this project, we got the dataset from the Kaggle website and then do the prediction regarding the chance of admission in
graduate school.

The dependent variable is Chances of Admission and independent variables are GRE Score,TOEFL Score,University Rating,SOP,LOR,
CGPA and Research.I generate the descriptive stats report using the pandas profiling and do the basic analysis of the whole 
data. By doing the analysis, we did three things:
    
    Removing all the missing values by the mean
    Standardization
    Check Multicollinearity

After doing all these steps, we simply did linear regression by making a model. Split our data into test and train. And then 
check the prediction. At last, we also did Lasso regression to confirm whether our parameter is true or not.
